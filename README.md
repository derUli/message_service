# message_service

This module for UliCMS 2018.3 and later versions enables backend users to send alert messages to other backend users.
The messages are deleted after they have been displayed.

The function of this module is comparable with the [messenger service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Messenger_service) of older Windows version except the difference that it doesn't support to send messages to external UliCMS sites.
